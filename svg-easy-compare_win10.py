""" A simple script to check if 2 SVG files have significative visual differences.

This script compares 2 .SVG files by exporting these files in .PNG, creating a mask showing the differences in the
two vector images, counting the white pixels and calculate the difference. It then puts the output data in a logfile.
See README.md for more information.
